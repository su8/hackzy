This is Qt 6 version of **hackzy**. It doesn't provide `analyze` and `solve` programs. 

---

# Compile with:

```bash
cmake
make -j8
sudo make install # if on linux or *BSD
```

Open Qt Creator and import this project folder if you want to edit/compile **hackzy** from the Qt Creator itself.

If on windows, you'll have to download the online installer and install qt 6 manually from the GUI installer.

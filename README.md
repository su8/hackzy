The picture above does **NOT** represent this game.

Terminal hacker game.

## Installation

If on windows, replace **srandom** with **srand**.

Tested with Visual Studio Code Editor, but you need to install MingW - https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases/download/12.2.0-rt_v10-rev0/x86_64-12.2.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v10-rev0.7z once downloaded extract it to **C:\MingW**, then re-open Visual Studio Code Editor, you might want to install C\C++ extensions if you plan to write C\C++ code with the editor. If you plan to contribute to this project go to **File->Preferences->Settings** and type to search for **cppStandard** and set c++ to c17 to both c++ and C

In Visual Studio Code, go to **Terminal->Configure Tasks...->Create tasks.json from template** and copy and paste this into it:

```json

    }
]
}
```

To compile the program press **CTRL** + **SHIFT** + **B** , wait until it compiles, after that press **CTRL** + **`** and paste this `cp -r C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME_GOES_HERE\Desktop\main.exe C:\MingW\bin;cd C:\MingW\bin;.\main.exe`

If on Linux or *BSD

```bash
make -j8 && 
sudo make install
```

I was inspired by https://github.com/The-Council-of-Wills/HacknetPlusPlus to create this game. I do use their **help** text.

The game is entirely written from my tablet with CxxDroid, only true up until to the 59th commit, afterwards the game is written from my brand new windows laptop.

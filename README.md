The picture above does **NOT** represent this game.

Terminal hacker game.

## Installation

If on windows, replace **srandom** with **srand**. Tested with Visual Studio Code Editor, but you need to install MingW - https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases/download/12.2.0-rt_v10-rev0/x86_64-12.2.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v10-rev0.7z once downloaded extract it to the current foldere and after that move it and rename it to **C:\MingW** then re-open Visual Studio Code Editor, you might want to install C\C++ extensions if you plan to write C\C++ code with the editor.

I was inspired by https://github.com/The-Council-of-Wills/HacknetPlusPlus to create this game. I do use their **help** text.

The game is entirely written from my tablet with CxxDroid.
